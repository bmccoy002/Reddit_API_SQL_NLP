# Reddit_API_SQL_NLP
This project showcase my understanding of APIs, basic SQL commands, and sentiment analysis. 

Purpose: This program is a simple sentiment analysis of the diction used in the Reddit posts. This can be useful in trying to understand Reddit user’s views on a specific topic. On a bigger scale, a company may want to use sentiment analysis to understand how people view their company or even a product of theirs. Data collected and analyzed from sentiment analysis will aid in a company’s business decisions.
