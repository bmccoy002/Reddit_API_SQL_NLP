# Reddit_API_SQL_NLP
This project showcases my understanding of APIs, basic SQL commands, and sentiment analysis. 

Purpose: This program is a simple sentiment analysis of the diction used in the Reddit posts. This can be useful in trying to understand Reddit user’s views on a specific topic. On a bigger scale, a company may want to use sentiment analysis to understand how people view their company or even a product of theirs. Data collected and analyzed from sentiment analysis will aid in a company’s business decisions.

Goal: My goal by analyzing the Colorado subreddit was to see what Reddit users were saying about Colorado and what words were used the most so I could understand their sentiment, whether it is positive or negative. Some of the posts may not have been opinions, but events as well. Not only would I be able to see their sentiment, but I can also see if they were posting about positive or negative events in Colorado.
